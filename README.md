Please read the directions described in the webpage before starting the game. 

Once the "start!" button is activated, the timer starts to run automatically.

Considering the directions, each question has 15 seconds to be answered, but if the user picks the wrong answer, 10 seconds are subtracted from the timer.

The game finishes when all of the questions are answered or the time runs out, whichever comes first. After that, the user should enter their initials to save the score. Once the game concludes, the user can confer the points by clicking in the link "View Highscores" (top left of the page).

Good luck!
